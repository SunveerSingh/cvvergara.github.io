            * OSGeoLive provides a production and marketing pipeline, providing value to a whole range of user groups.
            * Developers who package and support testing of their applications on OSGeoLive get their applications marketed at conferences, workshops and on the web.
            * Document writers get their documentation reviewed, translated into multiple languages and published.
            * Translators are provided with quality source documentation, and a publish through OSGeo web pages.
            * Conference organisers welcome presentations which explain the breadth of Geospatial Open Source, often having a VIP present a derivative of the OSGeoLive during keynote presentations, and adding value to delegates by giving away an OSGeoLive DVD or USB.
            * Geospatial educators and workshop presenters use the stable OGeo-Live Virtual Machine or USB for practical class room settings.
            * Which all leads to Architects and Developers discovering, and then incorporating Open Source Geospatial software in their projects.

           :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            GRASS GIS provides powerful raster, vector, and geospatial processing.
            It includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery.
            It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps.
            It includes over 400 built-in analysis modules and 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes.
            With over 30 years of continuous development, GRASS is both the oldest and largest Open Source GIS available.
            It is capable of very powerful analysis, but may not be as simple to get started with as other offerings with more of a geodata viewer focus.
            Many Open Source projects make use of GRASS's algorithms.

            OpenJUMP is a spin-off from the original JUMP project, which was Open Source but didn't accept improvements and updates from the community.
            This resulted in over 10 forks of the original code base. OpenJUMP provided a merging back together of many of these forks. 
            OpenJUMP is an easy to use and powerful deskstop GIS that enables users to edit, analyse, and display geographic data.
            It is particularly good at conflation, which involves aligning a feature which is shown in different locations on two different map layers.

            QGIS Server provides a web map service based on the popular QGIS desktop application.
            The close integration with QGIS means desktop maps can easily be exported to web maps by copying the QGIS project file into the server directory,
            and a nice touch is that the web maps look exactly the same as they do in the desktop.

            Note 
            GRASS GIS provides powerful raster, vector, and geospatial processing. It includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps.
            It includes over 400 built-in analysis modules and 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes.
            With over 30 years of continuous development, GRASS is both the oldest and largest Open Source GIS available. It is capable of very powerful analysis, but may not be as simple to get started with as other offerings with more of a geodata viewer focus. Many Open Source projects make use of GRASS's algorithms.

            Note 
            In 2003, the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure in Valencia, Spain, started migrating all their systems to Open Source Software. Part of this migration involved the development of gvSIG to replace ESRI desktop applications in use.
            gvSIG is a desktop GIS application designed for capturing, storing, handling, analysing and deploying any kind of referenced geographic information in order to solve complex management and planning problems.
            gvSIG is available in over 20 languages, and has a very strong following amongst Spanish speakers.

            Note 
            OpenJUMP is a spin-off from the original JUMP project, which was Open Source but didn't accept improvements and updates from the community. This resulted in over 10 forks of the original code base. OpenJUMP provided a merging back together of many of these forks.
            OpenJUMP is an easy to use and powerful deskstop GIS that enables users to edit, analyse, and display geographic data. It is particularly good at conflation, which involves aligning a feature which is shown in different locations on two different map layers.

            JTS, or Java Topology Suite, is a java library of spatial predicates and functions for processing geometries. It is used by most java based open source geospatial applications. It provides a complete, consistent, and robust implementation of fundamental algorithms for processing linear geometry on the 2-dimensional Cartesian plane.
